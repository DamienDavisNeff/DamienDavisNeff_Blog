## The Conversation

<b class="person-1">How is abandoning Ukraine in the United States’ best interest?</b>

<i class="person-2">Is it in our best interest to help them?</i>

<b class="person-1">
Yes. Supporting Ukraine weakens Russia while strengthening our alliances around the globe. It reinforces the idea of sovereignty while deterring aggression from other states.

If we allow them to invade an independent nation without consequence, it signals to other nations that aggression doesn't have negative repercussions.

Take China as an example, they already illegitimately claim Taiwan as part of their territory, if they see us give up on an ally, and let Russia just take parts of it, they may choose to be more aggressive defending that claim. That would be very problematic to not only us, but the rest of the world as we continue to heavily lean on Taiwan chip manufacturing.

Not only that, but losing Ukraine as an ally leaves us at a strategic disadvantage to Russia. The whole reason they cared so deeply about Ukraine’s potential NATO membership was that advantage it would give us having a member on their border.

We also guaranteed Ukraine’s security as part of the Budapest Memorandum in exchange for them giving up their nuclear arsenal. Breaking our promise to them signals to the rest of the world that giving up nuclear weapons was a mistake – making future arms control even more difficult, putting the entire world at risk.

I understand where you’re coming at but I’ll tell you the war over there has been going on since 2014 and had nothing to do with us in the first place. It started because of a revolution that took place in 2014 called the Revolution of Dignity.

It was only after Russia invaded that Ukraine begged to join nato. With that being said it’s a scuffle between two nations over an internal problem that we had no part in. Let’s look aside from our obligations to any treaties or deals we have for a second. 

By sending billions of dollars to Ukraine we are, under military law, engaging in the war so Russia has a justifiable reason to declare war. If Putin stood on his word one time and declared war it would mean world war 3. Obviously that wouldn’t be good for anybody. 
<i class="person-1-note">Under international law, providing aid is not engaging in war.</i>

This past administration has done nothing but fuel the flames to an aimless war that has been going on for over a decade with no real sight to pull out. At the moment however, our president is putting his foot down and Putin is now open to discussing a potential peace deal. 

I think ending a war in another country is a bigger move than fueling one regardless of what deals we may have had, and as far as I know there has been nothing said about stranding Ukraine and letting them fight their own war. People are dying and being conscripted on both sides for something stupid. We can either keep funding them or end it.

<b class="person-1">
It stopped being an internal issue when Russia invaded, it became an international incident. We have been aiding our allies for decades, none of which became justifications for war declarations. Besides, declaring war against any member of NATO, including the United States, would be an absolute disaster for Russia, and Putin’s not an idiot. 

The only person fueling the flames to an aimless war is the aggressor – Putin. Everyone else is doing what is necessary to stop an invasion without bending the knee. An end to this war is necessary, but President Trump is not putting his foot down, he’s bending the knee to Putin. Neither of them are negotiating peace in good faith. 

Peace and surrender are different, and every time Ukraine has given up territory, Russia has been back for more. There is no reason to trust Putin now, if he wanted peace, he wouldn’t have invaded.

<i class="person-2">
Putting his foot down to Zelenskyy when he demands money is what I mean. Bending a knee to Putin in a sense is absolutely right. 

You can either threaten military action against him or negotiate. You don’t have to trust him. If he makes a peace deal with us and breaks it then we’ll get involved. You threaten military action off the bat and he doesn’t bow then we have a wider scale conflict when he’s already said that he’s willing to negotiate.
</i>

<b class="person-1">
I absolutely agree that we shouldn’t threaten military force, but we need to ensure negotiations are done correctly — that is to say, ensure that any deal is enforced (whether that be by the United States, or another independent, trustworthy ally) and that Ukraine themselves are directly involved in the deal, rather than excluding them. In the meantime, we should continue to guarantee their security until negotiations prove to be anything more than a temporary ceasefire.
