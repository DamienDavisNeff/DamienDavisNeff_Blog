We are less than two weeks into Trump's Administration and he has regularly blurred the line between lawful acts and unchecked power. Even some of his legal acts have been reprehensible and a clear abuse of his authority. He has disregarded accountability on several occasions, has repeatedly threatened his rivals,-*-1, 2-*- and has hurt Americans and those closest to them.

## Unjust Pardoned

The most flagrant and unjust abuse of power from the Trump Administration is something I could've understood somewhat, if not for the scale of it. I am talking about the 1,500+ pardons for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riots.-*-3-*- 

If the Administration did its due diligence with these pardons, ensuring that only non-violent offenders were pardoned, I would be more forgiving of it. That isn't to say I wouldn't complain about them, but I wouldn't call them an extreme abuse of power. Donald Trump pardoned violent offenders and commuted the sentences of key leaders in the attacks,-*-4-*- those directly responsible for the abhorrent events of the day, the people responsible for leading the non-violent offenders into the building. 

These pardons are a disgrace, especially from the party who touts "law and order". Pardons exist to correct miscarriages of justice. All these offenders were rightfully punished, especially violent offenders. They were not victims of an unjust system — they were victims of their own crimes. 

Some may point to the preemptive pardons granted by former President Biden,-*-5-*- including those for the figures involved in the January 6th committee, as a counterpoint to Trump's pardons. However, like I discussed in <i>Whataboutism and Joe Biden</i>, justifying unjust actions based on other unjust actions is a dangerous precedent and, while Joe Biden's pardons were also an abuse of power, doesn't change that Trump's were as well.-*-6-*-

## Constitution Ignored

Trump's disregard for constitutional boundaries is unsettling, from statements like "<i>...calls for the termination of all rules and regulations, including those found in the Constitution</i>"-*-7-*- to clearly disregarding the Fourteenth Amendment while trying to overturn birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, one of his earliest actions. The administration attempted this by claiming that these children do not qualify under the 14th Amendment.-*-8-*- This is blatantly untrue,-*-9-*- and was swiftly challenged and blocked in court.-*-10-*-

## Firing Critical Staffers

Trump has been attempting to undermine independent institutions through strategic firing of critical staffers. This includes prosecutors from the Department of Justice who worked on January 6th cases, including those who secured convictions against individuals involved in the riots.-*-11-*- The purge did not stop with prosecutors, as it seems the President is preparing to fire thousands of FBI agents who worked on January 6th cases and on cases involving himself.-*-12-*-

This undermines the rule of law and sows fear within agencies, preventing them from pursuing justice in an independent manner. He is promoting loyalty over accountability, a clear sign of authoritarianism. 

## Illegally Freezing Funds

Trump's attempts to freeze federal funds didn't start with his new administration but echo a similar move from his first term as President. In 2019, President Trump attempted to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for political leverage, more specifically an investigation into Joe Biden,-*-13-*- then a Presidential Candidate, his rival. This flagrant abuse eventually led to his first impeachment, which was unfortunately unsuccessful.-*-14-*-

In his modern-day administration, he attempted to freeze ALL federal aid-*-15-*- (funds which were already allocated to different programs), leading to widespread confusion across federal agencies and state authorities-*-16-*- and disrupting essential programs. This sparked lawsuits incredibly quickly, leading to the memo's rescindment.-*-17-*- However, the Trump Administration continued to pursue the freeze, which resulted in a federal judge filing a restraining order — blocking the attempt.-*-18-*-

These repeated attempts to misuse federal funds to overstep his boundaries show that Trump learned nothing from his impeachment inquiry, and continues to abuse his power, undermining the authority of Congress, which passed these programs.

## An Authoritarian

The actions taken by the Trump Administration, especially those I covered here, are a clear sign that Trump does not respect the rule of law. He disregards accountability and attacks independent institutions, putting personal power over every other check and balance. His attempts to dismantle these systems, and attack those who call him out for it, signal a concerning push towards authoritarianism. 

We must stand firm against these efforts to protect our democracy, and ensure a peaceful — and legitimate — transfer of power in the next election. If we don't, if we bend the knee, the threat of an authoritarian  rule could become real, and our forefathers all fought too hard to let that happen.
