## But what about Joe Biden's pardons? 

The Right will point to Joe Biden's preemptive pardons of officials such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, Gen. Mark Milley, and the members of the January 6th Committee-*-1-*- as grounds to justify Trump's pardons for January 6th rioters. But justifying unjust actions based on other unjust actions is disingenuous and unfair.

The Left can argue that Biden's preemptive pardons were understandable — but that doesn't change that they were an abuse of power. He believed that Trump would abuse his power and attack these individuals,-*-2-*- by investigating and potentially prosecuting them. Even if Donald Trump does do this, one person's abuse doesn't justify another.

It sets a terrible precedent, and probably (and quite frankly, hopefully) wouldn't hold up in court. Handing out pardons before someone is charged with a crime implies that you can hand out a pardon before someone commits a crime. This means that, as President, you would be able to sponsor premeditated crime with no consequence. 

## Abuse is abuse.

Donald Trump pardoned nearly 1,600 January 6th rioters,-*-3-*- including violent offenders — people who brutally assaulted police officers and were found guilty of doing so.-*-4-*- Pardons are meant to be used in cases of unjust punishment,-*-5-*- and most of these people were punished justly. 

## My Stance

I stand on business — as in, I stand by my ethics and beliefs no matter who is taking the actions. If Donald Trump does something good, with good intentions, I will praise him. If Joe Biden does something bad, even with good intentions, I will criticize him. And if Logan Paul does something bad, with bad intentions, you know damn well I will criticize him too.
