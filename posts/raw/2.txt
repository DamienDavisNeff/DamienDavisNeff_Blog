## A Speedrun of My Ideology

<b>Trans rights are human rights</b> - <i>Gender identity is valid, as gender is a human construct different from biological sex; as such, trans women are women.</i>
<b>Marriage is not exclusive to a man and a woman</b> - <i>Love is love. Everyone has the freedom to marry whichever consenting party they choose, regardless of sex. After all, legal marriage is just for tax purposes anyway.</i>
<b>The Death Penalty is Immoral in Nearly All Cases</b> - <i>Our justice system defines a guilty verdict as "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt",-*-1-*- which lacks 100% certainty; the death penalty is irreversible, so such certainty is required.</i>
<b>Healthcare is a right, not a privilege</b> - <i>Every single person on Earth should have access to affordable healthcare, including mental health. This should not be controversial.</i> 
<b>Abortion is Healthcare</b> - <i>The choice should not be celebrated, but that choice is important for women's health. At the very least, exceptions for rape, incest, viability of the child, and the health of the mother should exist.</i>
<b>Climate change is real, and needs action</b> - <i>A overwhelming majority of scientists agree that climate change is real, and will harm humans if action is not taken.</i>-*-2-*-
<b>Social justice is crucial</b> - <i>Our systems, whether intentional or not, harm minorities. These systems need safeguards in place to avoid that.</i>
<b>Immigration is more complex than closed borders</b> - <i>While border security is important, helping immigrants thrive in their already existing lives and adding easier routes to obtain legal status solves the issue far more efficiently.</i>
